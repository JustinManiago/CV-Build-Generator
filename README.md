# CV-Build-Generator
This program is designed to randomly generate the different components of a character in the video game Code Vein. The build is generated in a way that ensures the player can equip all components without having any deficiencies. This means that no Gifts that the player cannot equip will be generated, and only Weapons and Blood Veils that the player has sufficient stats to equip will be generated.

# MySQL Connector/C++
In order for this program to function properly, the database that it accesses should be stored in MySQL Workbench.
